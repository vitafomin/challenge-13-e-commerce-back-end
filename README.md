# challenge-13-e-commerce-back-end

## Description
  
  In this weeks challenge I was tasked to complete the code for the backend of a e-commerce site. This application allows the user to get all, get one, create, update, or delete any data that they desire from their categories, products, and tags. When given a functional Express.js API the user is able to use MySQL to create their database using a schema file they created and running their seeds file with data. They are able to use sequelize to connect to their database. Once they connected their database they can test all their routes using a tool such as insomnia. They are able to test the category routes, product routes, and tag routes. All these routes have several functions. With all the routes the user is able to get all categories, products, and tags. The user is able to get a specific item from categories, products, and tags using the id. The user is able to create, update, and delete from all these routes as well. This application is great for anyone that manages a internet retail company. 


## Installation

For this application to work express.js, MySQL, Sequelize, and dotenv needs to be installed. 

## Usage

This is a great application for anyone looking to open or manage a internent retail company. It allows you to view all and specific the data within your company. It allow you to add, update and delete any data you desire. It is very efficient and saves you time. As all the business owners know time is money, so you know that this is the application for you!
